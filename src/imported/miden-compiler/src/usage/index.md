# Usage

The Usage section documents how to work with Miden's compiler tools. Key components include:

- **Command-line interface** ([`midenc`](./midenc.md)) - A low-level compiler driver offering precise
  control over compilation outputs and diagnostic information
- **Cargo extension** ([`cargo-miden`](./cargo-miden.md)) - Higher-level build tool integration for
  managing Miden projects within Rust's package ecosystem
